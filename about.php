                                <p>People are the engine of change, and when we work together, we can make a difference
                                    in your life. Some people may seem like they have it all together–a great job at a
                                    prestigious company or an enviable house with a backyard swimming pool; but what if
                                    you took a step back from looking at them through rose-colored glasses? What would
                                    happen if you saw them as they really are? Maybe their lifestyle isn’t as glamorous
                                    as it seems on the surface. Maybe there’s something about their relationship status
                                    (single or married), their past history with drugs or alcohol abuse issues (perhaps
                                    even violent behavior), etc., that could use some repair work right now!</p>

                                        when the whole world is witnessing so many challenges, when we are confronted
                                        with various existential teachings.</p>
